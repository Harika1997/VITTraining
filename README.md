# VITTraining

### Hey, welcome to the Julia Workshop! 

Today, we're going to go through the basics of [**Julia**](https://julialang.org), a language for data science and numerical computing. 

## Setup

For this workshop, we're going to use the [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com) service:

1. Go to https://juliabox.com
2. Login with your credentials (Google, LinkedIn, or GitHub)
3. Once things are set up, click on the **Sync** tab. We're now going to add this workshop repository to your JuliaBox. 
4. Copy the **Git URL** of this repository and paste it in the **Git Repositories** section on JuliaBox.
5. Click on the **+** to synchronize.

Once you go back to your **Jupyter** tab, you should see a new folder called **VITTraining**. (If not, click on the tiny sync button on the top right corner)
